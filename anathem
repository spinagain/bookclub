<h2>anathema by neil stephenson</h2>

<p id="bkm">bookmark: pg. 65</p>
<p>I'm enjoying this books so far. One might find the abundance of made up words annoying, but one might also find it to be a fun linguistic game.<p>

<p id="bkm">bookmark: pg. 208</p>
<p>Now that we are getting to know some of the characters and a pretty interesting mystery has been established, I can say that I like this book a lot right now.</p>
<p>The world is well developed and I find the monestary setting of the distant future very cool, especially their spheres and bolts. The contrast of their use of such high technology and their simple way of life (farming, beekeeping) is fun.</p>

<p id="bkm">bookmarK: pg. 252</p>
<p>still enjoying! poor -you-know-who-, but i'm sure they'll bounce back.</p>
