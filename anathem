<h2>anathema by neil stephenson</h2>

<p id="bkm">bookmark: pg. 65</p>
<p>I'm enjoying this books so far. One might find the abundance of made up words annoying, but one might also find it to be a fun linguistic game.<p>

<p id="bkm">bookmark: pg. 208</p>
<p>Now that we are getting to know some of the characters and a pretty interesting mystery has been established, I can say that I like this book a lot right now.</p>
<p>The world is well developed and I find the monestary setting of the distant future very cool, especially their spheres and bolts. The contrast of their use of such high technology and their simple way of life (farming, beekeeping) is fun.</p>

<p id="bkm">bookmarK: pg. 252</p>
<p>still enjoying! poor -you-know-who-, but i'm sure they'll bounce back.</p>

<p id="bkm">bookmark: pg. 427</p>
<p>Now it feels like we are on a proper adventure! New characters, new places, new ideas. Why is every sci fi book about space and aliens though?</p>

<p id="bkm">bookmark: pg. 702</p>
<p>Welp, it's about aliens after all. I had that feeling from the beginning but now it's disappointing since 99% of so called "science" fiction is about space and aliens. There is more to science than stupid space and aliens! But whatever. I'm still enjoying the book. The theoretical and philosophical discussions the characters have about space and time and consciousness are fun.</p>
