<h2>the difference engine by william gibson and bruce sterline</h2>

<p id="bkm">bookmark: pg. 65</p>
<p>I don't know if I have read a novel by two authors before, unless maybe certain ghost writers are actually multiple people. But this book si good so far, another once that uses too many gobbledygook words, but the world that is set up so far is interesting and the story seems like it is really about to kick off here. Hopefully it's a fun one.</p>
