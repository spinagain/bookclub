<h2>the difference engine by william gibson and bruce sterline</h2>

<p>I don't know if I have read a novel by two authors before, unless maybe certain ghost writers are actually multiple people. But this book si good so far, another once that uses too many gobbledygook words, but the world that is set up so far is interesting and the story seems like it is really about to kick off here. Hopefully it's a fun one.</p>

<p>This derby chapter is so much more fun than the previous chapter, which was honestly pretty dour when compared with the energy and excitement of this one. But it seems like the authors spent all their time resarching old clothing and they just throw out names with no descriptions, which is annoying. But that's a trivial complaint because the books is getting better and better! Can it keep up the momentum? Will it peeter out? What other sort of inventions might we see? I want to meet a real inventor...</o>

<p>Haven't been reading as zealously as I was when I started, but I'm stilly enjoying the book. Maybe losing interest though, since I seem to be hesitant to pick it up lately. Oh well, guess that's just how things go sometimes.</p>

<p>My enthusiasm for this books has been rekindled with the turn toward more exciting story telling, less frivolous jargon, and more action and suspense.</p>
